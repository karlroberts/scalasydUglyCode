# Ugly Code - Refactor demo

## ScalaSyd Wed 9th May 2018
This is the code base for my ScalaSyd talk on refactoring ugly procedural mutable scala code to be more
idiomatic of Scala.

While there are many parts of this codebase that could do with a tidy up, however
I am just focusing on `provider.api.mapifyHistoricPrices` for the demo.

To use this codebase simply use git to check out the codebase at tag "start" then go to "start_1" then "start_2" then
to "start_n" also aliased to "end" to see the progression of refactoring

    git co start
    git checkout start_1
    ....
    git checkout start_??
